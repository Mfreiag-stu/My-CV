                      <p>I'm a young portuguese citizen eager to get back to work. I have a bachelor's degree in Political Science and I'm currently finishing my master's thesis in Political Economy. I'm deeply interested in policial analysis and policy anaylis as well as research. My main fields of interest are energy policy and decision-making theories, particularly those related with behavioral sciences. In addition, I have held positions in the areas of data analysis and technology, which allowed me to develop my skills in these areas.
